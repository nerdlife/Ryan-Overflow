I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.

If the train goes left 99% of the time, then you guess left. If it alternates, then you alternate your guesses. If it goes one way every 3 times, you guess the same... In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it. This is more or less how branch predictors work. Most applications have well-behaved branches.
